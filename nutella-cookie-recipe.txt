Serves: 14-16
Ingredients
1 cup (5oz/150g) all purpose flour
1 cup (8oz/240g) Nutella
1 large egg (or egg substitute for cookies)
Instructions
Heat the oven to 350F (180oC), and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Add the Nutella, flour and egg to a large bowl. Mix until well combined.
The mixture will form a thick dough but should be moist enough to roll into balls.
Using your hands roll about 2 tablespoons of dough into balls. Place cookies on your baking sheet and flatten them slightly with your fingertips or the bottom of a glass.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, until they are cooked around the edges and still slightly soft in the middle. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then cool on a baking rack. Enjoy!
